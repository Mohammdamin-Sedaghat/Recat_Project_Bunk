<h1>Here are a few projects which I made within a few weeks!</h1>

I was mainly doing them because I wanted to explore the possibilities of React-Vite Alongside design.

I believe the coolest one is **Assembly Endgame**, in which you must save the world from having to code in Assembly using a hangman-style game. 

You can also look at **Flowrise-Prismic**, where I explored the CMS platform Prismic to see how it works. It was my playground to work on the <a href="https://uwdbc.com/">UWDBC website</a>!

**Chef Claude** is another really cool app where you add the ingredients you have on hand and the chef will suggest the perfect recipe to make with what you have!

**Meme Generator** talks for itself, it uses an API to access the latest memes, and you can interact with each meme to make a better version!

Lastly, **Tenziz** is a strategic game that you might have played in your childhood. If you haven't then this is the perfect time to do it!
